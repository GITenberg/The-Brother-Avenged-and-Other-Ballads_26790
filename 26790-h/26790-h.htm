5</span>THE BROTHER AVENGED</h2>
<p>I stood before my master&rsquo;s board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The skinker&rsquo;s office plying;<br />
The herald-men brought tidings then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That my brother was murdered lying.</p>
<p>I followed my lord unto his bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By his dearest down he laid him;<br />
Then my courser out of the stall I led,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with saddle and bit arrayed him.</p>
<p>I sprang upon my courser&rsquo;s back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the spur began to goad him;<br />
And ere I drew his bridle to,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full fifteen leagues I rode him.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>And when I came to the noisy hall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the Kemps carouse were keeping,<br />
O then I saw my mother dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the corse of my brother weeping.</p>
<p>Then I laid an arrow on my good bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bow that never deceived me;<br />
And straight I shot the King&rsquo;s Kempions twelve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of my brother who had bereaved me.</p>
<p>And then to the Ting I rode away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the judges twelve were seated;<br />
Of six to avenge my brother I begged,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of six protection entreated.</p>
<p>For the third time rode I to the Ting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For deep revenge I lusted;<br />
Up stood the liege-man of the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And at me fiercely thrusted.</p>
<p>Up stood the liege-man of the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a furious thrust toward me;<br />
And the Judges twelve rose in the Ting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And an outlaw&rsquo;d man declared me.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Then I laid an arrow on my good bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the bow to its utmost bent I;<br />
And into the heart of the King&rsquo;s liege-man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sharp, sharp arrow sent I.</p>
<p>Then away from the Ting amain I sped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my good steed clomb in hurry;<br />
There was nothing for me but to hasten and flee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And myself &rsquo;mong the woods to bury.</p>
<p>And hidden for eight long years I lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the woods so lonely;<br />
I&rsquo;d nothing to eat in that dark retreat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But grass and green leaves only.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d nothing to eat in that dark retreat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save the grass and leaves I devoured;<br />
No bed-fellows crept to the place where I slept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But bears that brooned and roared.</p>
<p>So near at hand was the holy tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our Lady of mercies tender;<br />
The King of the Swedes his followers leads,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rides to the Church in splendour.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>So I laid an arrow on my good bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I looked from the gap so narrow;<br />
And into the heart of the Swedish King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sent the yard-long arrow.</p>
<p>Now lies on the ground the Swedish King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the blood from his death-wound showers;<br />
So blythe is my breast, though still I must rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the forest bowers.</p>

9</span>THE EYES</h2>
<p>To kiss a pair of red lips small<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full many a lover sighs;<br />
If I kiss anything at all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it be Sophy&rsquo;s eyes.<br />
The eyes, the eyes, whose witcheries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have filled my heart with care;<br />
Too dear I prize the eyes, the eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.</p>
<p>Were I the Czar, my kingly crown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My troops and victories,<br />
And fair renown I&rsquo;d all lay down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To kiss but Sophy&rsquo;s eyes.<br />
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>The charming eyes, whose witcheries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have filled my heart with care;<br />
Too dear I prize the charming eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;ve seen a fairer face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though hers may well surprise;<br />
A form perhaps of lovelier grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But, oh! the eyes, the eyes!<br />
The matchless eyes, whose witcheries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have filled my heart with care;<br />
I well may prize the matchless eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.</p>
<p>What with the polished diamond-stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can vie beneath the skies?<br />
Oh, it is vied and far outshone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By Sophy&rsquo;s beaming eyes.<br />
By Sophy&rsquo;s eyes, whose witcheries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have filled my heart with care;<br />
Well may I prize the beaming eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>The sun of June burns furiously,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And brooks and meadows dries;<br />
But, oh, with more intensity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burn cruel Sophy&rsquo;s eyes!<br />
The wicked eyes, whose witcheries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have filled my heart with care;<br />
Too dear I prize the wicked eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.</p>
<p>O, soon beneath their piercing ray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like some parched plant which dies,<br />
Wither shall I, poor youth, away?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all for Sophy&rsquo;s eyes.<br />
But bless the eyes, whose witcheries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have filled my heart with care;<br />
Till Death I&rsquo;ll prize and bless the eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sophy Ribeaupierre.</p>

12</span>HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON<br />
<i>From the Greek</i></h2>
<p>With the leaves of the myrtle I&rsquo;ll cover my brand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Harmodius and Aristogiton of yore;<br />
When the tyrant they slew, and their dear native land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They caused with just laws to be governed once
more.</p>
<p>O, beloved Harmodius! thou still art not dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Isles of the Blest thou still livest, they
say;<br />
Where the swift-heel&rsquo;d Achilles and bold Diomed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through sweet flowery meadows continually stray.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>With the leaves of the myrtle I&rsquo;ll cover my
blade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Harmodius and Aristogiton of yore;<br />
Who, whilst the high rites to Athena were paid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bold tyrant Hipparchus extended in gore.</p>
<p>And on earth ever, ever your glory shall glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Harmodius and Aristogiton, sun-bright;<br />
Because ye the damnable tyrant laid low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And restored to your country her law and her
right.</p>

14</span>MY DAINTY DAME</h2>
<p>My dainty Dame, my heart&rsquo;s delight,<br />
Star of my watch, serene and bright;<br />
Come to the green wood, mild is May,<br />
Cosy the arbours, come away!</p>
<p>In me thy spouse and servant see,<br />
To silvan hall I&rsquo;ll usher thee;<br />
Thy bed shall be the leaves heaped high,<br />
Thy organ&rsquo;s note the cuckoo&rsquo;s cry.<br />
Thy covert warm the kindly wood,<br />
No fairer form therein e&rsquo;er stood.<br />
Thy dress, my beauteous gem, shall be<br />
Soft foliage stript from forest tree;<br />
The foliage best the forest bore,<br />
Served as a garb for Eve of yore.<br />
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Thou, too, throughout the summer day<br />
Shalt rove around in Eve&rsquo;s array.<br />
My Eve thou art, my ever dear,<br />
Thy Adam I&rsquo;ll attend and cheer.</p>
<p>Come to the green wood, come away,<br />
The floor with grass and flowers is gay!<br />
There &rsquo;neath no tree shalt thou descry<br />
In churlish guise old jealousy.<br />
Fear not my love, afar is now<br />
The loon, thy tiresome lord, I trow;<br />
To all a jest amidst his clan<br />
He choler deals in Cardigan.<br />
Here, nestled nigh the sounding sea,<br />
In Ifor&rsquo;s bush we&rsquo;ll ever be.<br />
More bliss for us our fate propounds<br />
On Taf&rsquo;s green banks than Teivi&rsquo;s bounds;<br />
Thy caitiff wight is scarce aware<br />
Where now we lurk, my little fair.<br />
Ah! better here, in love&rsquo;s sweet thrall,<br />
To hark the cuckoo&rsquo;s hearty call,<br />
Than pine through life in castle hall!</p>

21</span>THE ELF BRIDE <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a></h2>
<p>There was a youthful swain one day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did ted the new mown grass;<br />
There came a gay and lovely may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From out the nigh morass.<br />
Clad in a dress of silk was she,<br />
Green as the leaves which deck the tree,<br />
Her head so winsomely to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With bulrush plaited was.</p>
<p>That lass he wooed, his suit she heeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And married are the pair;<br />
To bridal bed his wife he leads&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But what befell him there?<br />
<!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>He found, fear-stricken and amaz&rsquo;d,<br />
That he a rough oak trunk embrac&rsquo;d,<br />
Instead of the enchanting waist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of his mysterious fair.</p>
<p>Then straight abroad a voice he heard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which sang the window through;<br />
These were the words the voice proffer&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If my report be true:<br />
&ldquo;Come out to her whom thou didst wed!<br />
Upon my mead thy couch is spread.&rdquo;<br />
From this he guessed with some elf maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he had had to do.</p>

23</span>THE TREASURE DIGGER</h2>
<p>O, would that with last and shoe I had stay&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without wild desires;<br />
And, ah! no trust in Satan had laid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That prince of liars!</p>
<p>Each Saturday night, when slept the rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Away I stroll&rsquo;d<br />
To the forest, so murky and drear, in quest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of buried gold.</p>
<p>And then I beheld the hopping fire glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The briar behind;<br />
And down to the earth my wishing-rod low<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Itself declin&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>I dug then, and gripped the chest&rsquo;s ring amain,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And held it stout;<br />
But the copper deceitful burst in twain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fiends laughed out.</p>
<p>Just, just as long was the treasure my own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I trembled with fright;<br />
But soon as I held it secure, down, down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It sank from sight.</p>
<p>Ye devilish pack, what grin ye at?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I fell not your prey;<br />
I&rsquo;ll trust no more in old women&rsquo;s chat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in cross-shaped way.</p>
<p>I go by my last and shoe to stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without wild desires;<br />
And ne&rsquo;er more in Satan I trust will lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That prince of liars!</p>

25</span>THE FISHER</h2>
<p>The fisherman saddleth his good winged horse,<br />
To be on the deep seems to him his best course.</p>
<p>Against the white strand loud and hoarse the wave breaks,<br
/>
And towards the strand now the fisherman makes.</p>
<p>And up when the fisher his fishing-line drew,<br />
A fine golden fish on the hook met his view.</p>
<p>Then he laughed in his beard: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve of fish seen a
store,<br />
But ne&rsquo;er one with golden cloth kirtle before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I a gold piece for each gold-scale
possess&rsquo;d,<br />
With poverty I should no more be distrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>With its tail the fish &rsquo;gan the bench furious to
smite,<br />
And a strange dance it seemed to the fisherman&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wealthy man, be not, I pray thee, so gay,<br />
A much quieter part a poor fisher should play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The golden fish heard every word as it lay,<br />
Began straight to talk and discourse in this way:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m full as rich, fisherman, as thou art poor,<br
/>
And soon for thee happiness I will procure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight cast me again in the ocean my home,<br />
And a well-doing man thou, I swear, shalt become.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Queen of the ocean my mother is, know,<br />
She linen and bolsters on thee shall bestow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is King in the depths of the sea,<br />
And healthy and strong he shall cause thee to be.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;My lover he sorrows for me in the brine,<br />
My golden cloth kirtle shall also be thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the sovereign of fishes I care not a straw,<br />
On myself, if I did, I but laughter should draw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For thy mother&rsquo;s fine cushions I care little
more,<br />
My own Queen could make better ware any hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if thou to a wooer thy troth didst allot,<br />
The repose of two lovers destroy I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trembling gold fish in the water placed he:<br />
&ldquo;From such wretched captures the Lord preserve me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If to-morrow a like one upon my hook bite,<br />
I shall perish of hunger, poor miserable wight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He the rest of the day sat at home by his hearth<br />
And spake not a word that repeating is worth.</p>
<p>He early next morn in his boat his seat took,<br />
And straightway adjusted a bait to his hook.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>And soon as he&rsquo;d overboard cast the fish-line,<br
/>
The float it descended deep under the brine.</p>
<p>Then he laughed in his beard, and with bitterness said:<br />
&ldquo;A catch of another gold fish I have made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thin lengthy line he up-drew half unwilling,<br />
And, behold! there upon the hook hung a gold shilling.</p>
<p>And I can forsooth and for certainty say,<br />
That he for delight had no rest the whole day.</p>
<p>But as oft as the line he up-drew from the tide,<br />
Upon the hook never a fish he descried.</p>
<p>For whene&rsquo;er for the fish he upon the hook sought,<br />
He found that a shilling of gold he had caught.</p>

29</span>THE CUCKOO</h2>
<p>Abiding an appointment made,<br />
Upon the weed-grown steep I stayed,<br />
One morning mild when May was new,<br />
And fresh the down was fraught with dew.<br />
The meads were flowering, bright the woods,<br />
The branches yielding thousand buds.<br />
My lips employed in song the while<br />
On Morfydd of the merry smile.<br />
&rsquo;Twas then as round I cast my eye<br />
With mighty wish the maid to spy;<br />
Though, howsoe&rsquo;er my sight I strained,<br />
No glimpse of Morfydd I obtained.<br />
I heard the cuckoo&rsquo;s voice arise,<br />
Singing the song which most I prize.<br />
To each Bard true most sweet I trow<br />
His music on the mountain&rsquo;s brow.<br />
<!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Therefore, as called by courtesy,<br />
I greeted him in poesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, dear Cuckoo, with thy strain<br />
A herald thou from heaven&rsquo;s domain;<br />
To us the tidings thou dost bear<br />
Of summer, blissful season fair.<br />
Of summer which to greenwood shade<br />
Entices forth the Bard and maid;<br />
Which decks with foliage dense the grove,<br />
And through all nature breathes of love.<br />
O, dear to me that note of thine,<br />
It seasons love like choicest wine;<br />
Whilst, doating fondness to chastise,<br />
What cutting taunt in &lsquo;Cuckoo&rsquo; lies!<br />
But, pretty bird, I pray declare<br />
Where lingereth now my lady fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, poet, what delusion great<br />
Doth fill this year thy foolish pate?<br />
&rsquo;Tis harbouring a useless pain<br />
One thought of her to entertain.<br />
With all her store of winning charms,<br />
<!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>She weds her to another&rsquo;s arms.<br />
Believe me, when I say to thee<br />
A mate of thine she may not be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, I&rsquo;ll not believe thy voice,<br />
Dare not defame my bosom&rsquo;s choice.<br />
That nymph, the fairest &rsquo;neath the sun,<br />
Has sworn an oath, a solemn one;<br />
She vowed by her baptismal rite,<br />
Beneath the bough one blessed night,<br />
Her hand my own enclasping hard,<br />
To live and die with me, her Bard.<br />
The minister that mystic night<br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
